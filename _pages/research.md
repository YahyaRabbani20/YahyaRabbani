## Process Optimization and Simulation in Chemical Engineering

This section provides a summary of my experience in simulation and optimization within chemical engineering. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have focused on enhancing chemical processes and computational models, using tools such as **MATLAB**, **Aspen HYSYS**, **ANSYS Fluent**, **OpenFOAM**, and **LIGGGHTS**.

Key areas include:

1. **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: Applying CFD techniques for fluid flow and heat transfer simulations, I have worked on projects such as two-phase fluid systems and solar chimney energy generation, optimizing parameters like flow rates and thermal conductivity.

2. **Process Optimization**: With **Aspen HYSYS**, I have conducted process simulations to optimize distillation columns, reactors, and heat exchangers, enhancing yields and reducing energy consumption across various plant systems.

3. **CFD-DEM Coupling**: Combining CFD (using **OpenFOAM**) with DEM (using **LIGGGHTS**), I explored the behavior of magnetorheological fluids, focusing on fluid-particle interactions under magnetic fields. This research, including work from my master’s thesis, contributed to understanding shear and dynamic yield stress properties in such fluids.

This summary reflects my commitment to advancing chemical engineering through computational methods and simulation tools. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration on related projects.
