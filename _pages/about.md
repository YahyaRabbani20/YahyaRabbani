I am a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) specializing in nanobiotechnology and machine learning applications for digital health. My work focuses on the development of single-molecule fluorescence sensors (such as DNA-SWCNT) for highly sensitive detection in health applications, targeting biomarkers like glucose, cancer biomarker, and nitric oxide for inflammation monitoring.

My expertise spans:
- **Machine Learning and Data Analysis**: Applying machine learning for sensor response prediction, with experience in Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Pandas.
- **Chemical and Process Engineering**: Background in process engineering and modeling, including extensive work in experimental sensor synthesis and analysis using advanced techniques like fluorescence spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging.
- **Bioinformatics**: Specialized in representing sequence information of single-stranded DNA in bioinformatics, utilizing machine learning to optimize DNA-SWCNT optical sensors for the sensitive and selective detection of key health biomarkers, including glucose, cancer markers, and nitric oxide for inflammation monitoring.
- **Research and Publication**: Published multiple high-impact journal articles on topics such as nanobiosensors, machine learning in bioinformatics, and fluid dynamics. I am actively contributing to new research in chemical and nano engineering.
